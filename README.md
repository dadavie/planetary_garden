**Problem Statement**

The global warming and the greenhouse effect have been affecting many nature components:

- Arctic is very likely to become ice-free
- Precipitation patterns change
- Frost-free seasons, together with growing ones, lengthen

These surely affects plants, and the following questions arise:

* Can we keep our planet green?

* Can we relocate potentially affected plant species to similar climate conditions?

The current project aims to seek possible solutions for the posed problems. Based on world climate datasets, including bioclimate features, we cluster the world map, hence revealing similar conditions for plants. We investigate cluster changes, as well as moving in and out of species from them. Based on this information, we give reallocation suggestions for the plants.
